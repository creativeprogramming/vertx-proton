= Vert.x Proton

This component facilitates AMQP integrations for Vert.x by providing a thin wrapper around the
link:http://qpid.apache.org/[Apache Qpid] Proton AMQP 1.0 protocol engine.

WARNING: this module has the tech preview status, this means the API can change between versions. It also
         exposes Proton classes directly because it is not an abstraction layer of an AMQP client, it is rather
         an integration layer to make Proton integrated with Vert.x and its threading model as well as
         networking layer.

== Using Vert.x Proton

To use Vert.x Proton, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-proton</artifactId>
  <version>3.4.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile io.vertx:vertx-proton:3.4.0-SNAPSHOT
----

=== Creating a connection

Here is an example of connecting and then opening a connection, which can then be used to create senders and
receivers.

[source,java]
----
ProtonClient client = ProtonClient.create(vertx);

// Connect, then use the event loop thread to process things thereafter
client.connect("hostname", 5672, "username", "password", connectResult -> {
  if (connectResult.succeeded()) {
    connectResult.result().setContainer("my-container/client-id").openHandler(openResult -> {
      if (openResult.succeeded()) {
        ProtonConnection conn = openResult.result();
        // Create senders, receivers etc..
      }
    }).open();
  }
});
----

=== Creating a sender

Here is an example of creating a sender and sending a message with it. The onUpdated handler provided in the send
call is invoked when disposition updates are received for the delivery, with the example using this to print the
delivery state and whether the delivery was settled.

[source,java]
----
connection.createSender("myQueue").openHandler(openResult -> {
  if (openResult.succeeded()) {
    ProtonSender sender = openResult.result();

    Message message = message();
    message.setBody(new AmqpValue("Hello World"));

    // Send message, providing an onUpdated delivery handler that prints updates
    sender.send(message, delivery -> {
      System.out.println(String.format("Message received by server: remote state=%s, remotely settled=%s",
                                       delivery.getRemoteState(), delivery.remotelySettled()));
    });
  }
}).open();
----

=== Creating a receiver

Here is an example of creating a receiver, and setting a message handler to process the incoming messages and their
related delivery.

[source,java]
----
connection.createReceiver("myQueue").handler((delivery, msg) -> {
  Section body = msg.getBody();
  if (body instanceof AmqpValue) {
    System.out.println("Received message with content: " + ((AmqpValue) body).getValue());
  }
  // By default, the receiver automatically accepts (and settles) the delivery
  // when the handler returns if no other disposition has already been applied.
}).open();
